  <h2>About Cryptocurrency</h2>
  <p>Cryptocurrency is a digital currency designed to work as a medium of exchange
     through a computer network that is not reliant on any central authority, 
     such as a government or bank, to uphold or maintain it.</p>

<h3>Countries With Large Crypto Communities</h3>

<p>Cryptocurrency is not a novelty anymore. Some people only heard about it, 
  while others trade, buy, sell, and pay with digital money on a daily basis. 
  But how can you use crypto to its full potential? One of the ways is to find a place 
  where you are going to feel comfortable and prosperous with your virtual assets. 
  A place where you would not have to pay taxes on your crypto or, at least, 
  could pay the lowest possible taxes. Maybe even a country where you can pay with 
  digital coins, cash them out, or use crypto-friendly banks.
  Let’s see what countries have those features and why they are considered to be 
  crypto-friendly.</p>

    <li>USA</li>

    <li>CANADA</li>
    <li>CHINA</li>

  <h2>What is Blockchain</h2>

  <p>A blockchain is a distributed database or ledger shared across
     a computer network's nodes. They are best known for their crucial role in 
     cryptocurrency systems, maintaining a secure and decentralized record of 
     transactions, but they are not limited to cryptocurrency uses. Blockchains 
     can be used to make data in any industry immutable, meaning it cannot  be altered.
     Since a block can’t be changed, the only trust needed is at the point 
    where a user or program enters data.</p>

  <h3>What is Bitcoin</h3>  
  <p>Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonymous person or team who outlined 
    the technology in a 2008 white paper. It's an appealingly simple concept: 
    bitcoin is digital money that allows for secure peer-to-peer transactions on
    the internet. Unlike services like Venmo and PayPal, which rely on 
    the traditional financial system for permission to transfer money and on 
    existing debit/credit accounts, bitcoin is decentralized: any two people,
    anywhere in the world, can send bitcoin to each other without the involvement
    of a bank, government, or other institution. Every transaction involving Bitcoin 
    is tracked on the blockchain, which is similar to a banks ledger, 
    or log of customers funds going in and out of the bank. In simple terms,
    it's a record of every transaction ever made using bitcoin.
    Unlike a bank's ledger, the Bitcoin blockchain is distributed across the entire 
    network. No company, country, or third party is in control of it; and anyone can 
    become part of that network.</p>
